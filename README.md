# SDORP: SDN based Opportunistic Routing for Asynchronous Wireless Sensor Networks
To simulate SDORP, a new platform with a graphical user interface that provides details of simulations runs with other important pieces of information is developed. The toolkit is developed using C# and WPF in .net 4.5.
Developed by Muhammad Umar Farooq Qaisar et al. (muhammad@mail.ustc.edu.cn)
# Bugs
If any bugs are encountered during the execution of the toolkit, please restart toolkit, or you can download the new version of this toolkit. If there is any error occurs, the toolkit will shut down automatically.
# How to use the toolkit of simple testing
1) Open SDORP.exe or run the SDORP.sln project in the Toolkit folder. If the toolkit can’t run pleases refer to (http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~anmande/miniflow/#_Installation_Problems).

2) Import the required network topology, from File-> Import Topology.

3) From the main menu, select Coverage->Random

4) To select the rate of sending packet, from the main menu Test-> Select one Source per time, and select the desired rate.
